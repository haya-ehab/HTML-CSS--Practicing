# Code Challenge Championship Practice – HTML & CSS Only

Welcome to my repository of practice projects built for the **Code Challenge Championship**! This repo showcases solutions to various frontend challenges that are expected at the senior level, using **only HTML and CSS** — no JavaScript.

These challenges are designed to improve my problem-solving skills, sharpen my understanding of layout techniques, and push the limits of what’s possible with just HTML and CSS.
